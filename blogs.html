        <h1>Interesting Facts about HTML</h1>
        <p>
          HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for creating webpages. Webpages are usually viewed in a
          web browser. They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark and
          describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can show them correctly.

          HTML can also be used to add meta information to a webpage. Meta information is information about the web
          page. For example, the name of the person who made it. Meta information is not usually shown by web browsers.

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a interpreted, high-level programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
          specification. This language is also characterized as weakly typed, dynamic, multi-paradigm and
          prototype-based .

          Here are some interesting facts about javascript:

          Along with HTML an CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main things of the www (World Wide Web). It enables
          interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. A majority of websites use it and all
          major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it.
          JavaScript is single threaded. This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its
          working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly.
          Despite the fact that there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, respective
          standard libraries and syntax, these two languages are distinct and differ significantly in design.
          Like all other scripting languages, arrays and objects can be created with a brief shortcut syntax. These
          literals structure the basis of JSON data format.
          JavaScript supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provides a concise and powerful
          syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.
