            "Javascript is the duct tape of the Internet." -Charlie Campbell. Have you ever thought about the
            programming language which powers the web? The most commonly used programming language in the world? Yes, it
            is Javascript but what is Javascript and where do we use it.

            In a web page, HTML is used to structure the page, CSS is used to add styling like colors, fonts, etc but a
            web page with only HTML and CSS is static, meaning a user cannot really interact with the page, here is
            where Javascript comes in.

            Now let's see what is Javascript exactly, Javascript is a cross-platform, interpreted, object-oriented,
            just-in-time compiled scripting language. It is used to make web pages interactive(for example if the user
            clicks a button then the theme of the website changes, or after scrolling the page a pop-up message may be
            displayed).It is used to make dynamic web pages.JavaScript has a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a fundamental set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and
            statements. Javascript can be used for both client and server side programming.
        </p>

        <h2>Features of JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            Cross-platform: Javascript is supported by many OS such as Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

            Object Oriented: Javascript is an object oriented programming language, but it is not a class based OOP
            language like Java, C++, etc. It is a prototype based OOP language.

            You might be familiar with class based OOP in Java or C++ where we write a class, objects are instantiated
            for it and when we want the inheritance to happen we create another class which inherits from the parent
            class specified, where as in prototyped based OOP there is no such concept of classes objects directly
            inherit from other objects this is possible because every object has another object called Prototype
            attached to it by default which acts as a template object from which the object can inherit properties and
            methods.

            Scripting language: Javascript is a scripting language it depends on the browser for the execution of
            scripts. It is mostly used as a client-side scripting language this means that it runs on the client's
            system (browser) and handles the webpages displayed to the user and the processing related to it such as
            cookies, sessions, local storage.

            Dynamically typed: Javascript is dynamically typed, it means type checks happen at run-time. In JS we don't
            have to explicitly declare what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. For example
            when we declare var a, now a can have a string stored in or a number as well.

            Loosely/weakly typed: Loosely/weakly typed languages allows for implicit conversion of types. For example,
            in Javscript we can declare a var a and give it some value and if we use + operator with a string variable a
            will be treated as string and as a number if we do the operation with a number, var a is converted
            implicitly here.

            Case sensitive: Javascript is sensitive to the case of the letters.

            Browser support: Javascript is supported by all major web browsers example Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.

            JIT compiled is compiled by a JIT(Just in time) compiler which converts the JS code to byte code.

            Interpreted: Javascript is using an interpreter to convert the byte to machine code hence is it an
            interpreted language. light weight and interpreted language.

            light-weight: Light weight refers to a language which has fewer language constructs(any syntactically
            allowable part of a language such as if..else,functions etc), since JS fits this criteria it is a light
            weight programming language. (Note: It should be noted that with each new version released new constructs
            get added so JS is getting less light weight but it is still light weight compared to other programming
            languages like C++, Java etc)
        </p>

        <h2>
            Limitations of JavaScript
        </h2>
        <p>
            Client-Side Security Javascript code is run on the client-side, there is a higher chance for bugs and other
            lapses to be exploited by harmful entities. This makes some users disable Javascript entirely

            Different browsers different results different browsers use different engines sometimes the result can be
            different for the same code but nowadays such cases are minimal.

            No Multithreading or Multiprocessing does not have multithreading or multiprocessing capabilities.

            No reading/writing of files: Javascript does not allow direct reading/writing files due to security reasons.
